# Digital Video Stabilization

In this assignment we first stabilize a video without any moving object using sparse and dense optical flow.
Then we stabilized videos with independent moving object by first segmenting out the moving object using RANSAC algorithm.

The sample output can be seen in this repository. The effect of warping the homography of unstabilized video frames is also shown in the following demos.
