This file contains the answers to the questions posed.


1)  2022-01-18	15:00:00	18:00:00

2) The virtual environment I have used is SpyderIDE. This is because I am comfortable 
   with Jupyter Notebook and SpyderIDE of anaconda distributions and mostly work in this 
   environment.

3) Deactivating a virtual environment is followed by a simple command "deactivate" in 
   the powershell. After activating an environment, the name of the environment appears 
   as the prefix of the shell prompt. After giving the command "deactivate", the 
   environment name disappears and no longer acts a prefix. The shell prompt reverts 
   back to the initial path.

4) I have installed opencv --version 4.5.5.62

5) The total time taken for installing python, creation of virtual environment, 
   installing the required libraries is 30 min.

6) The readme.txt file is often the first file that the users read. It is a text file 
   that contains information for the user about the project, along with instructions, 
   help, or details associated with it.
   My understanding of the contribution section is, for group tasks, each individual of
   the group submits a readme file which contains what he/she contributed to the tasks
   i.e describing what part of work is done by the individual. He/she must specify all 
   the tasks performed by him/her that led to completion of the tasks. The individual 
   will be graded according to the knowledge gained by him/her and contribution part.
